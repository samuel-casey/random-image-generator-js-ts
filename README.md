# ~Random Imager~ in JS & TS

## Background

This repository houses a homework assignment I completed while in week 2 of a General Assembly Software Engineering bootcamp. The original assignment was designed to teach us JavaScript + jQuery. Upon completing the original assignment, I refactored my code into TypeScript. This is my first front-end project that utilizes TypeScript.

### Technologies used

- html
